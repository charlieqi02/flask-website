This repository contains three website programs implemented by flask and other python third party libraries. We provide (i) web-mysql, a simple website implementation with functions to connect mysql and allow to add and query the information you need, (ii) calculator, mainly using sympy library, we build a website which allows user to do both simple four-rule calculation and advanced calculus calculation, (iii) spider, we build a  web crawler tool to get movie information and store it into mysql database. They are just simple implementations aimming to provide a preliminary understanding of web application programming.
