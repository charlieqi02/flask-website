# flask-website

This repository contains four website programs implemented by flask and other python third party libraries. We provide (i) web-mysql, a simple website implementation with functions to connect mysql and allow to add and query the information you need, (ii) calculator, mainly using sympy library, we build a website which allows user to do both simple four-rule calculation and advanced calculus calculation, (iii) spider, we build a  web crawler tool to get movie information and store it into mysql database. They are just simple implementations aimming to provide a preliminary understanding of web application programming, (iv) message,  a simple online communication platform that allows users to share information or ideas with others anywhere, at any time. Users simply need to enter their name and the message they want to leave in the input box, then click submit, and the information will be posted on the website for everyone visiting the site to see.

Developers can extend and customize these applications, adding more features and functionalities to meet diverse requirements.
